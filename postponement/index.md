We have taken the difficult decision to **postpone Proactive Workplace Mental Health Summit 2020**.

The summit was due to have taken place on Monday 30 March at the University of Suffolk.

The Coronavirus outbreak has resulted in speakers and delegates cancelling attendance. As the situation is developing and remains unclear, we have decided to postpone the summit until **March 2021**.

**We’ll also be at a new venue: [The Atrium at Wherstead Park](http://whersteadpark.co.uk/the-atrium-for-events/).**

We apologise for any inconvenience and disappointment this causes.

## Online seminars

We are planning on running a series of online seminars from September 2020. We’ll keep you updated as soon as we have further details.

## Refunds

If you already have tickets you can either retain them for use in March 2021 or contact us for a refund.

Our contact details are:

- help@hivesuffolk.co.uk
- 01473 921268 (Suffolk Libraries finance department)

Thank you for your understanding.

Kind regards,

Bruce Leeke, Hive Suffolk
