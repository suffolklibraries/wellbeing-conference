We have taken the difficult decision to **postpone Proactive Workplace Mental Health Summit 2020**.

The summit was due to have taken place on Monday 30 March at the University of Suffolk.

The Coronavirus outbreak has resulted in speakers and delegates cancelling attendance. As the situation is developing and remains unclear, we have decided to postpone the summit until September 2020.

When we have a new date for the summit weâ€™ll publish it here.

We apologise for any inconvenience and disappointment this causes.

### Refund policy

If you already have tickets you can either retain them for use in September 2020 or contact us for a refund.

Our contact details are:

- 01473 921268 (Suffolk Libraries finance department)

Thank you for your understanding.

Kind regards,

Bruce Leeke, Hive Suffolk
