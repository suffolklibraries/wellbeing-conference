<div class="__prose ">

  <h2 id="why-a-positive-approach-to-mental-health-culture-change">Why a positive approach to mental health culture change?</h2>

<p>Research from Deloitte shows that workplaces taking a proactive, positive approach to mental health culture change can expect a return on investment of at least 8:1. A positive working environment also supports wider economic resilience and leads to thriving communities. So organisations with a strong mental health framework in place are finding the rewards are not just social – they can affect the bottomline.</p>

<p>Research commissioned by Suffolk Libraries highlights the growing wellbeing challenges facing the county, and issues such as loneliness and social isolation can affect employees at work as well as outside of it. For this reason, HIVE has teamed up with workplace wellbeing specialists Suffolk Mind to provide practical and transferable solutions to businesses across East Anglia so you can meet these challenges.</p>

<p>It can be a difficult road, but by working on staff education, awareness and intervention, the benefits are often remarkable. The conference will explore the fantastic work taking place in mental health and wellbeing across our region, and how you can apply these experiences to your business.</p>

<h2 id="what-well-cover">What we’ll cover</h2>

<p>Our focused, intensive one day programme will cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the cost of poor mental health and stress to employers?</li>
  <li>ROI to employers from timely mental health interventions in the workplace, and from preventing ill health</li>
  <li>What can we learn from best practice examples?</li>
  <li>Common workplace behaviours that are a sign of stress and a need for support</li>
  <li>Listening to the ‘Voice of the Employee’ by collecting, managing and acting on employee feedback</li>
  <li>Multi-generational and multi-cultural differences</li>
  <li>Disability discrimination under the Equality Act, Disability Discrimination Act, Mental Health Act review</li>
  <li>Making reasonable adjustments and supporting employees to return to work</li>
  <li>Making changes to your workplace environment that can help prevent mental ill health</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-attend">Why attend?</h2>

<p>We have designed the agenda to support companies of different sizes and at various stages of their mental health policy development – from ‘starting from scratch’ to advanced.</p>

<p>We’ll have case studies, panels and expert speakers to support delegates in their own journey. It will be a chance to meet other like-minded professionals and share stories and extend your network.</p>

<h2 id="mental-health-best-practice-framework">Mental Health Best Practice Framework</h2>

<p>Not only will you be able to meet, network and share your stories of wellbeing and mental health custodians and champions with like-minded people, the programme aims to help you take away some helpful tools and ideas.</p>

<p>You’ll receive full copies of slides plus a Best Practice Mental Health Framework – a collection of resources that will detail the key areas to consider in building an effective Mental Health policy for your workplace.</p>

<p>The resource pack covers a broad range of areas including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Defining and understanding the resilience vs MHFA debate</li>
  <li>The key steps to building your wellbeing policies and framework</li>
  <li>Managing board commitment and continuous employee buy-in</li>
  <li>Monitoring and measuring outcomes: using surveys and other solutions</li>
