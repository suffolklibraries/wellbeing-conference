Public Health Suffolk recognises the importance of health at work, collaborating with Suffolk Chamber of Commerce over the past two years to develop the ‘Building a Resilient County’ toolkit. This practical resource has advice and case studies from Suffolk organisations, with plenty of tips and ideas to help employers define resilience and improve general health and wellbeing.

At the same time, the new Healthy Workplace Award sets new accreditation standards which support organisations to celebrate what they do well, and identify where they can improve.
