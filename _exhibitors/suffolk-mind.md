One in four of us will experience a mental health problem each year and at Suffolk Mind, we believe we can all do more to look after ourselves and the people around us. We want to make Suffolk the best place in the world for talking about and taking care of mental health.

Suffolk Mind works across the mental health continuum from wellbeing to ‘severe and enduring’ mental ill-health, proving support and information for everyone. We offer a range of services across Suffolk: anger and anxiety management courses, counselling, Waves, supported housing, Ecotherapy and Workplace Wellbeing. At Suffolk Mind we want to help everyone to make a life that works.
