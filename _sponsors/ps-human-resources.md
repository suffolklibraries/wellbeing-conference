PS Human Resources provide HR support to small and medium sized businesses. As consultants they believe in the following:

* Understanding your business and focussing on adding real value
* Being a problem-solver and having answers for you and your employees
* Simplifying everything
* Putting people over policies
* Focussing on the reality, not theory
* Focussing on what really matters to drive the business forward and not getting hung up on trivial details.

They offer a range of tailored packages including HR audits, consultancy, management development, recruitment, coaching as well as a cloud-based HR system to automate those time-consuming HR administrative tasks.

They were one of five finalists in the Personnel Today Awards for HR Consultancy of the Year for 2019.
