Given diverse working environments, industries and types of organisation there is no one-size fits all mental health policy. There are, however, some key sectors which need special focus and support in East Anglia, from rural farming workers to industrial and transportation.

- Creating an inclusive working environment, and why this is important for isolated workforce
- Men’s mental health: Making a start and using positive mental health champions to provide support in a crisis and promote positive mental health
- Great local initiatives: Taking inspiration from local mental health initiatives how they did it
- Scalable models on a tight budget
- Communication and extending the awareness and reducing stigma within traditional working communities
