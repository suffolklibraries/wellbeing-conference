Although best known for his career in football and charity, David’s background was in the food industry, successfully starting, building and selling two profitable companies. Experienced as both Chair and NED, David is collegiate yet challenging. He assembles teams with complementary skills and creates alignment and ownership through effective delegation in goal-setting and driving growth. He is recognised as a good communicator, networker and convener.

Today, David is a Business and Life Coach as a Vistage Group Chairman, successfully creating their first peer groups for Business Leaders in Suffolk.

Current business interests include consultancies with the Football Association (Chair of Technical Advisory Board and UEFA Licensing Committee), Argent Related (putting sport/activity/wellbeing and education at the centre of the redevelopment of Brent Cross South) and Regional Chairman for Coutts Bank in East Anglia.

He is a Trustee of Winston Churchill Memorial Trust and The Beacon Fellowship, a Patron of National Citizen Service (NCS) and, locally, President of Ipswich Citizens Advice Bureau and Patron of the Samaritans in East Suffolk.

Previously he was Chairman of Ipswich Town Football Club for 14 years, responsible for overhauling and modernising the business from 1995 onwards. During this time, he also chaired the Football League in the late 90s for two years and served the Boards of both the Football Association and the Football League for 12 years.

From 2008-2015, he was the founding Chairman of St George’s Park and led the creation, funding and construction of the National Football Centre, which opened in October 2012. Focusing on Coach Education, David has been integrally involved in developing a new personal leadership and high-performance culture for English football and a hub to engage wider interaction with other sports and business.

In charity, he has been a long-term advocate of Community Foundations, chairing Suffolk Community Foundation from 2005-2013 and UK Community Foundations from 2013-2018.

He was appointed CBE in January 2013 for services to football and local charity, granted an Honorary Doctorate by University of East Anglia in 2004 and created Deputy Lieutenant for Suffolk in 2005.

He is married to Mona, has two children - Sophie (32) and Tom (30) - and lives near Woodbridge in Suffolk.
