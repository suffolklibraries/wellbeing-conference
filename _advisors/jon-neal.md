Jon Neal is Chief Executive of Suffolk Mind, the mental health charity. With an ambitious aim of making workplaces across the country the best environments for people to meet their ambitions – whatever they may be – the organisation promotes an innovative way of looking at preventing mental ill health.

We all have emotional needs that must be met in order to stay at the wellbeing end of the mental health continuum. By addressing barriers to meeting needs like control, achievement and privacy, we can create workplaces that outperform all others.

Jon started at Suffolk Mind four years ago, following a career in communications, marketing and public affairs. He lives in Suffolk with his family and is an occasional Parkrunner and oft-disappointed Tottenham fan.
